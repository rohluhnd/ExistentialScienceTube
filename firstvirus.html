    The earliest viruses likely evolved from pieces of genetic material that broke away from their original cell, allowing them to find a new host and replicate. Over time, viruses have developed increasingly complex methods of replicating and surviving, including the development of enzymes that allow them to break into host cells and take over the cell's genetic machinery.</p>

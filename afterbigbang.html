  <p>The video describes the events that occurred immediately after the Big Bang, the massive explosion that created our universe. It explains that the universe rapidly expanded and cooled, eventually forming hydrogen and helium atoms. Over time, these atoms combined to form galaxies, stars, and planets. The video also explains that the universe is still expanding and evolving, and will continue to do so for billions of years to come.</p>

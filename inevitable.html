    This video explores the possibility that the universe was always meant to be and that the existence of life may have been predetermined. It discusses the scientific theories behind the Big Bang and the possible reasons why our universe is so finely tuned for the existence of life. It also examines the idea that the universe could be part of a larger, predetermined cycle and that our universe is simply a step in a much larger process.</p>

  <p>This video takes a deep dive into the idea that consciousness is an illusion and how it might be explained. It looks at the evidence from neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology to explain how humans could be living in a world of illusions. It presents and refutes arguments from both sides of the debate, looking at how the concept of consciousness is being redefined in the 21st century. With the help of experts and real-life examples, this video will help us understand the concept of consciousness and how it may or may not be an illusion.</p>

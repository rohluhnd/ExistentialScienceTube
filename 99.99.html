  <p>The other percent of life that didn't evolve the same way as us consists of the millions of species of plants, fungi, and animals that exist on Earth. These species are incredibly diverse and varied, and they represent the vast majority of species on our planet.

    They evolved over millions of years, adapting to the changing climate, competition, and other environmental pressures in order to survive. They are incredibly resilient and adaptable, and many of them have been able to survive in hostile and extreme environments.
    
    These species provide us with essential resources, such as food and medicine, and they also play an essential role in maintaining the balance of our planet's ecosystems. Without them, our planet would not be able to support life in the same way that it does now.
    
    We may not have evolved the same way as these species, but we should still respect and protect them as best we can. We have a responsibility to ensure that their populations remain healthy and viable, so that they can continue to provide us with the resources we need to survive.</p>
